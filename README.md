study project - rest, jdbc, jsf, mysql, json 

This is my study project representing my basic skills in java ee, rest, payara server, maven, mysql, jdbc and writing/editing local doc-files.


This is a restful web service that provides you crud operations with your music(vinyl/cd) labrary.
API works with json messages.

To launch this service do next:

1. clone and open the project into your ide
2. create a database using CreateDB.sql file (XS_Project/files)
3. create a connection with database in your ide
2. clean, build and deploy the project

Any comments about the application and its implementations are very welcome!

Thank you!
